              The HSS Council is the ultimate authority of the Society.
              Comprised of 22 members, the Council includes 15 members elected
              from the membership (5 elected each year for 3-year terms), 7
              officers that make up the Executive Committee (President,
              Vice-President, Treasurer, Secretary, Editor, Council Delegate,
              and Executive Director; the Editor and Executive Director are ex
              officio non-voting members), and the immediate Past President.

              It is expected that Council members attend each of the 3 annual
              meetings for which they were elected. It is also expected that
              Council members will respond in a timely way to ad interim matters
              and will serve on various committees. Council activities consist
              primarily of discussing and voting on critical issues, such as
              budgets, policies and procedures, approving delegates for service,
              and other important elements.
